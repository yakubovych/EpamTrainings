### - LibraryOfProject contains general interfaces and classes;
### - OuputOfTasks contains main output of all tasks and of course *App.config* with all paths for all tasks.
### - For work of logger created *App.config* with static way to the path *"..\..\..\LogInfo.txt"*. Use this way because default path was *"HomeworkLogger\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1\"*. More comfortable to have this file in root of project folder.
