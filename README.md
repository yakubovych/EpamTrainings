# EpamTrainings
## Tasks of offline part Epam trainings:
## 1. Task with structures (HomeworkStructures);
## 2. Task with enums (HomeworkEnums);
## 3. Task with exceptions (HomeworkExceptions);
## 4. Task with IOStreams (HomeworkIoStream);
## 5. Task with logger (HomeworkLogger).
### - LibraryOfProject contains general interfaces and classes;
### - OuputOfTasks contains main output of all tasks and of course *App.config*.
### - For work of logger created *App.config* with static way to the path *"..\..\..\LogInfo.txt"*. Use this way because default path was *"HomeworkLogger\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1\"*. More comfortable to have this file in root of project folder.
